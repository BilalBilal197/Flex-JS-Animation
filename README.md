# Challenges faced
Vanilla Javascript is best for making 2D animations. although 3D.js is a more suitable library for creating 3D animations but, for the sake of demonstrating the mastery of JavaScript, the 3D animation is implemented using vanilla Javascript.

# Future Direction 
The Project will contain the following effects
1. Nine Two Dimentional Loader Animations
2. Nine Hover effects
3. A street scene demonstrating implementation of frame movements
4. 3D Box or Dice
5. A clock implemented using Javascript DOM manipulation
